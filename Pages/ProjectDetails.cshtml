    <p class="text-gray-600 mb-8 text-lg text-left"> <!-- Increased margin bottom -->
        RettVest Home Kennel and Pension is developed as a side project, for which I am currently responsible for the
        management of the website. The website owners sought a user-friendly platform that includes a carousel feature
        and a form showcasing the logos of the pet food brands they represent. This project is built using Angular,
        complemented by Tailwind CSS and Daisy UI.

            Here we focus on our color palette choices, aligning with the project's theme and goals. The choice of
            emerald as the primary color is deliberate; it evokes feelings of tranquility and renewal, making it an
            ideal choice for a project centered around care and compassion, such as a home kennel and pension. Emerald
            also represents growth and harmony, which resonates with the nurturing environment we aim to provide for the
            pets.

            The font choice of Roboto enhances the design with its contemporary style and versatile nature. Roboto's
            geometric forms and open curves create a sense of approachability and friendliness, making the text engaging
            for the audience. Furthermore, its wide range of weights allows for a clear visual hierarchy, helping to
            emphasize important information without overwhelming the viewer. This makes Roboto not only aesthetically
            pleasing but also functional, ensuring that the content is both accessible and appealing.

        The carousel was designed with user-friendly buttons that seamlessly integrated with the website's overall
        aesthetic. On mobile devices, the carousel displays one image at a time, providing a focused viewing
        experience, while on desktop, it showcases three images side by side, allowing users to easily compare and
        engage with the content.
        <br /><br />
        The images were provided to us and were meticulously optimized to adhere to a standard of under 200KB per
        image to ensure fast loading times and a smooth user experience. Additionally, we ensured that all images
        were formatted consistently to align with the design principles of the site, creating a cohesive and
        visually appealing layout. This attention to detail not only enhances the aesthetics of the project but also
        improves functionality, ensuring that users can navigate the carousel intuitively.

    <p class="text-gray-600 text-base md:text-lg mb-6">
        The buttons were designed as shortcuts to enhance user navigation, allowing visitors to access specific
        features or sections of the site more efficiently. Each button is accompanied by intuitive icons that not
        only improve usability but also serve as a visually appealing complement to the homepage.
        <br /><br />
        This design choice emphasizes our commitment to user experience by minimizing the number of clicks needed to
        reach desired content, ultimately facilitating a smoother and more enjoyable browsing experience. By
        incorporating icons, we provide users with quick visual cues that make navigation easier, especially for
        those who prefer visual elements over text.
        <br /><br />
        Additionally, these buttons contribute to the overall aesthetic of the homepage, adding a dynamic and
        interactive element that invites users to explore further. Their strategic placement enhances the layout,
        ensuring that important functions are readily accessible without overwhelming the user interface.

            The owners of RettVest Home Kennel and Pension wanted to create a simple yet effective way to present the
            pet food brands available at their kennel. They envisioned a section that includes the logos of the brands,
            along with their prices, to provide visitors with a clear and accessible overview.
            <br /><br />
            By displaying the brand logos, it becomes easier for customers to identify the products they prefer, while
            the inclusion of prices helps them make informed choices. This initiative aims to support pet owners in
            selecting high-quality food options for their furry friends.
            <br /><br />
            By providing this information in a straightforward manner, RettVest hopes to foster a sense of trust and
            connection with its visitors, ensuring they have all the necessary details to care for their pets
            effectively.

        <!-- Summary about the project -->
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-6 md:text-3xl">Project Summary</h2>

        <p class="text-gray-600 text-base md:text-lg mb-6">
            This project served as a valuable opportunity to learn and implement several modern web technologies,
            including Angular, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Sass. Each of these tools brought unique advantages to the
            development process, allowing for the creation of a responsive and visually appealing website.
            <br /><br />
            Working with Angular enhanced my understanding of component-based architecture, enabling me to build
            reusable UI components that are easy to manage and maintain. TypeScript introduced a layer of type safety,
            making the code more robust and reducing the likelihood of runtime errors. Tailwind CSS offered a
            utility-first approach to styling, allowing for rapid design changes without the need to write custom CSS
            for every element. Lastly, Sass provided powerful features for writing organized and maintainable
            stylesheets.
            <br /><br />
            Overall, this project not only improved my technical skills but also deepened my appreciation for how
            different technologies can work together to create a seamless user experience. It was an enriching
            experience that reinforced my commitment to continuous learning and professional growth in web development.
