    <!-- Kort beskrivelse av prosjektet -->
    <p class="text-gray-600 mb-8 text-lg text-left">
        In this HTML and CSS assignment, we were limited to using only these two languages—no frameworks or additional
        languages were permitted. The task included specific user cases with a target audience, theme, and a set of
        images that we needed to integrate into the design. The target audience was children aged 6 to 16, so I focused
        on creating an engaging and lively layout to appeal to them.<br></br>

        To bring some energy to the design, I used SVGs and a wavy footer to add dynamic visual elements, along with
        icons suited to a younger audience. The project was awarded an A based on design, code quality, and alignment
        with the target group.

            For the color palette, I focused on green tones as the foundation. I started by selecting a specific shade
            of green that I felt would work well with the theme, giving a fresh and friendly look that aligns with the
            youthful target audience. From this main shade, I built a palette by adding three complementary green tones.
            These colors were used consistently throughout the design to create a cohesive and visually appealing
            experience.

            The chosen font for the project was Lora, which adds a playful yet readable quality to the design. Lora’s
            subtle curves and balanced style give the text a friendly feel, appealing to a younger audience while
            remaining clear and easy to read. The combination of color and typography was aimed at creating an inviting
            and engaging design that would resonate with the intended audience.

        I began the project by creating a mind map to establish a clear overview of the task. This initial step allowed
        me to brainstorm ideas freely, organizing my thoughts around key elements like layout, color scheme, typography,
        and user interaction. The mind map helped me break down the project requirements and visualize how different
        components could come together to meet the needs of the target audience.<br></br>

        Mapping out ideas in this way was especially useful in identifying the main focus areas early on and ensuring
        all design choices would align with the theme and age group. By having this structured overview, I was able to
        approach the design with a well-defined plan, which made it easier to transition into sketching initial layouts
        on paper. This preparatory stage set a solid foundation, guiding the development process and making sure that
        each part of the project served a clear purpose.

        To make the design more engaging, I created alternating cards with ample spacing on the sides and between each
        card. The cards alternated between green and white backgrounds, which added a visual rhythm to the layout and
        made each card more interesting to read. This alternating color scheme, combined with well-placed images, helped
        create a visually appealing experience that guided the viewer's attention naturally from one card to the next.
        The result was a dynamic, reader-friendly design that felt both organized and lively.<br></br>
        On the technical side, optimizing the images was a key focus. I used a combination of GIMP and a terminal tool
        called ImageMagick, which provided an efficient workflow for processing multiple images. This approach allowed
        me to avoid limitations commonly found in online optimization tools, which often restrict the number of images
        you can optimize at once. Additionally, I set up a fallback to JPEG format for the images, as older browsers do
        not always support the WebP format. By implementing this fallback, I ensured compatibility across a wider range
        of browsers.<br></br>

        Through careful optimization, I reduced the file sizes significantly by cutting down on unnecessary data and
        lowering the KB size of each image. This process improved the overall site performance, raising my performance
        score from 93% to 95%, which contributed to a faster, more efficient user experience.

        To add more energy and a playful touch to the design, I actively used SVG images, which I customized with my
        chosen color palette. This allowed me to maintain a cohesive style while bringing more liveliness to the layout,
        which made the design more engaging and suitable for the young target audience. By implementing SVGs with
        consistent colors, I was able to create visual harmony across the design, enhancing its appeal without
        overwhelming the content. The flexibility of SVGs also allowed for smooth scaling across different screen sizes,
        contributing to a visually dynamic yet accessible experience.

        The footer was designed with a wave pattern, adding a lively, flowing element to the page. This wave effect
        brings a sense of movement and excitement, aligning well with the playful tone of the overall design. By
        incorporating this wave-generated footer, I aimed to create a visually interesting endpoint that feels connected
        to the rest of the page, adding an extra touch of character that appeals to the young target audience. The
        footer design also reinforces the sense of cohesion and liveliness present throughout the site.

    <p class="text-gray-600 text-base md:text-lg mb-6">
        In summary, it was enjoyable to work on a project that focused solely on HTML and CSS, as it allowed me to see
        how far I could go with just these foundational technologies. By working within these constraints, I was able to
        explore creative solutions to make the design engaging and functional without relying on additional frameworks
        or scripts. This exercise highlighted the potential of HTML and CSS to create visually dynamic, interactive, and
        user-friendly designs. It was a valuable experience that strengthened my understanding of front-end fundamentals
        and reinforced how powerful these tools can be on their own.
